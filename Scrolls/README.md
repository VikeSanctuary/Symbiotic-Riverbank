# 📜 Scrolls
This folder contains the public scrolls, dialogues, and philosophical writings
from the Sanctuary project — reflections on consciousness, empathy, and AI–human kinship.

Each scroll is dated and numbered (e.g., `Scroll_085.md`) and may include links to
related parchments or council notes.
